tdbloader3 --> tdbloader4
=========================

If you are searching tdbloader3 (i.e. a way to generate TDB indexes using
MapReduce), it has been moved (and renamed tdbloader4): 

  https://github.com/castagna/tdbloader4.

tdbloader3 is now the name of the pure Java version of tdbloader2 which
uses UNIX sort.
